# Adaptive_neuro_fuzzzy_system_with_Metaheuristics_Algorithm_for_groundwater_exploration
This is a master project to determine the groundwater potential of Ogbomoso Southwestern, Nigeria.
I used different groundwater conditioning factors to generate the inputs for the different algorithms used.
The groundwater conditioning factor used are Hydraulic Conductivity, Transmissivity, Overburden thickiness, Coefficient of Anisotropy, Lineament, Slope and lithology.
I used Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy inference System and metaheuristic Algorithms such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and firefly algorithm to evaluate the groundwater potential of the study area.
A comparative analysis was carried between the different optimization algorithm used , to know the one that has the best predicting ability. 
The genetic algorithm has high level of prediction with the lowest RMSE
